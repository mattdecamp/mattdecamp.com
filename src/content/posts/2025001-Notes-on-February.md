## Music
This month I released a new-to-you-old-to-me instrumental recording called "Recess." I recorded the tracks for this back in 2010 at an old duplex apartment in Athens at a time when I was living by myself. I imagined a group of musicians in the round playing this tune in the front room while the children at the school across the street were outside playing during recess. Maybe you can picture that while you listen.

For a long time I was dissatisfied with how the original mix turned out, and it wasn't until last year I had another go at it, adding a few more pieces of instrumentation, and beefing up the overall sound.

The track is [available for free on my Bandcamp](https://decamp.bandcamp.com), and all the places you can stream music.

## Coding
Still chipping away at my site redesign...

While I'm sticking with Tailwind to style it this time around, I don't think I would use it again for a project this small. It's just a little too tedious for my taste. On larger projects, for sure; Tailwind is a great tool to utilize there. But when it comes to my site or sites of similar size, in my opinion, nothing beats writing your own CSS.

## Gaming
Started and finished [_Luigi's Mansion 3_](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/luigis-mansion-3-switch/). A delight! My seven-year-old is getting into now, too.

## Work
The band is official back on the road after a six month break, with its first official shows over Valentine's Day weekend. It's a good feeling, and we're getting loads of enthusiasm and support from the fans. Next run is later this month down in St. Augustine.

## Exercise
The days are starting to stretch out and the temperatures are rising, so I've been able to get a lot more running time in during the week. I may even try signing up for a race some time soon!

Finished this one today, actually, but I'll count it for February. A clever ode to the Wodehouse with hints of _Confederacy of Dunces_. My kind of humor.
