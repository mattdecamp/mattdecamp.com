## Vibe

Primarily tired and somewhat overwhelmed most days. But this was a good month for family time and watching the kiddos be their beautiful selves.

As the years have passed, I have felt less and less of the holiday spirit. But our oldest renewed it for me this year with his enthusiasm for it. He's triggered a lot of childhood memories and reminded me to not be such a stuck-up parent all the time.

## Music

Remixed two *old* songs of mine and put them out into the world. Felt really good to do.

I have another one I hope to get out before the spring, but it's proving to be pretty tricky. And then I want to record some of the more recent stuff I've written. Keep the momentum going, ya know?

## Listened To

- I mostly listen to the [soundtracks of Trolls movies](https://music.apple.com/us/album/trolls-band-together-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1709149482) since that is my five-year-old's current obsession.
- [The Neighborhood Listen](https://art19.com/shows/neighborhood-listen).
- Dr. Dog. Specifically, reacquainting myself with the [*We All Belong*](https://www.discogs.com/release/1634334-Dr-Dog-We-All-Belong) and [*Fate](https://drdogmusic.bandcamp.com/album/fate)* albums.
- A ton of Christmas music.

## Books

- [#3](https://bookshop.org/a/93821/9781250191786) in the Murderbot Series.
- [*A Closed and Common Orbit*](https://bookshop.org/a/93821/9780062569400). I finished this on New Year's Day, but it still counts for December, lbh. Really loved escaping into this world.
- 2023 is the year I became a sci-fi person!

## Looking Ahead

- I can't find time to play guitar since the weather has turned colder and the days darker. It's impossible inside with a baby napping every few hours. I know that will change, but I want to make more time to practice this next month. I miss it so.
