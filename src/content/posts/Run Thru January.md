## Vibe

My January vibe was mostly about the kidsâ€™ routines: Getting them where they need to be, helping out with homework, cooking dinner, etc. I love it all except for the fact that it continues to leave me no time for my own projectsâ€¦. But there I go again griping about time.

Whatâ€™s the saying? I need to make the time, right? I donâ€™t disagree with that, but it is *tricky*, and I can hardly keep my eyes open past 8 pm anymore.

## Work

- Worked to launch a new single.
- Lots of table setting for the rest of the year.
- Established a social media presence for Merchandise, which is already making a world of difference reaching fans.

## Music

- Of my own music? Pretty much no progress this month â€“Â which is fine. Maybe one new idea made it into voice memosâ€¦? Iâ€™m OK with it for now.

## Listening To

- Ethan Gruska - [*Slowmotionary*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/slowmotionary/1207369662)
- So much Gillian Welch
- Beatles re-mixes

## Books

- [*Exit Strategy* by Martha Wells](https://bookshop.org/a/93821/9781250191854) (My fourth Murderbot! Love them all so far.)
- [*The Return of Martin Guerre*](https://bookshop.org/a/93821/9780674766914) by Natalie Zemon Davis (via rec. from [Cup of Coffee](https://cupofcoffee.substack.com/i/138246856/natalie-zemon-davis) newsletter)
- ðŸŽ§Â [*The Circle* by Dave Eggers](https://images-us.bookshop.org/ingram/9780345807298.jpg?height=500&v=v2-50a53c5442ca222b54cd2e3183f6e2d2) (I didnâ€™t expect it to be such a bummer, but enjoyed it nonetheless)

## Looking Ahead

- Work is a great kind of busy. Lots of surprises coming for the fans.
- Birthday party planning for my oldest.
- An early Spring?
- Building a new version of this site which will hopefully be done by March!
